# TwitterAnalysis 
The " Twitter Sentiment analysis " project is a comprehensive guide to building a analysis model
specifically focused on Twitter data. This model aims to uncover people's attitudes and feelings towards various topics.
In this project, we'll delve into creating a  model to understand how people are expressing their views regarding various
topics. By analyzing real time tweets from Twitter, we will harness the power of machine learning to distinguish and 
categorize the different sentiments expressed in these tweets. Throughout this project, we will pinpoint three primary
categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The outcome of this project will not only showcase the technical prowess of 
building a analysis model but also offer valuable insights into public opinion concerning various topics on Twitter. 
As it analyses the public opinions regarding various topics, it also helps in real time brand improvement and brand 
tracking for any brand on twitter.
